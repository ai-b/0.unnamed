//and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost.

//Input Format
//There are  lines of numeric input: 
//The first line has a double, mealcost (the cost of the meal before tax and tip). 
//The second line has an integer, tippercent (the percentage of mealcost being added as tip). 
//The third line has an integer, taxpercent (the percentage of mealcost being added as tax).
